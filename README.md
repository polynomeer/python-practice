# Python Practice Repository

This repository is a structured Python playground for learning, experimentation, and deep exploration of Python language features, patterns, and tools.  
It supports personal learning, automation, technical blogging, and tool-based development, organized by topic and purpose.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `playground/` | A freeform space for quick tests and spontaneous code. No structure or polish required. |
| `core-concepts/` | Fundamental Python topics like control flow, data types, functions, classes, exceptions, and basic OOP. |
| `api-snippets/` | Examples using Python standard libraries and modules like `collections`, `itertools`, `datetime`, and `pathlib`. |
| `features/` | Learning how specific Python features and language syntax work. Great for usage-focused learning (e.g., `match-case`, `f-strings`, `dataclass`, `asyncio`). |
| `coding-recipes/` | Reusable, real-world code patterns for solving common problems (e.g., file processing, in-memory cache, CLI tools). Useful for interviews and production inspiration. |
| `patterns/` | Implementations of design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc., adapted to Python idioms. |
| `architecture/` | Examples of application structure such as layered architecture, modularization, MVC, and DDD-like designs. |
| `testing/` | Testing-related topics including unit tests (`unittest`, `pytest`), mocking, test discovery, and parametric testing. |
| `tooling/` | Developer tools for formatting, linting, type checking, automation, packaging, and coverage (`black`, `mypy`, `tox`, `pre-commit`, etc.). |
| `utilities/` | Task-oriented helper scripts for automation or real-world workflows. Examples include subtitle extraction, DB-to-Excel exports, and batch file renaming. |
| `labs/` | Experimental code to test hypotheses, language behaviors, performance edge cases, or language quirks. |
| `internals/` | Deep dive into Python internals: memory model, garbage collection, GIL behavior, AST/bytecode, and module loading. |
| `benchmarks/` | Micro-benchmarks for comparing performance of different implementations, algorithms, or APIs using `timeit`, `memory_profiler`, etc. |
| `blog-samples/` | Clean and well-documented code snippets intended for blog posts, presentations, or tutorials. |
| `study-sources/` | Code written by following books, courses, or tutorials (e.g., Fluent Python, Real Python, CS50, or Udemy). Organized per source. |
| `drafts/` | Unpolished code, scratch work, and exploratory drafts not yet sorted into other categories. |

## üß™ How to Use

- Each directory is self-contained and purpose-driven.
- Run scripts directly with `python script.py`, or use `poetry`, `venv`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt` as needed.
- Use the `playground/` or `drafts/` directory to experiment before structuring code into a proper category.

---

## üß∞ Development Tips

- Keep code clean and readable.
- Use `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `pytest`, etc. for quality and testing.
- Prefer small, self-contained scripts in `utilities/`.
- Use `README.md` files in subfolders to document what you're testing or learning.
