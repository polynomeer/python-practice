# Python Practice Repository

This repository is a structured Python playground for learning, experimentation, and deeper understanding of Python.  
It's organized by purpose: from basic feature exploration to internal behavior analysis and production-grade patterns.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `playground/` | A free space for trying out code without constraints. Great for drafts, quick tests, and debugging. |
| `core-concepts/` | Fundamental Python topics such as variables, functions, control flow, classes, exceptions, and basic OOP. |
| `api-snippets/` | Examples using Python standard libraries and modules like `collections`, `itertools`, `datetime`, and `pathlib`. |
| `features/` | Practical usage of Python language features and syntax: list comprehensions, dataclasses, decorators, f-strings, type hints, etc. Focused on "how it works." |
| `coding-recipes/` | Reusable solutions for real-world problems and interviews (e.g., file watchers, in-memory caches, CLI apps, JSON serializers). |
| `patterns/` | Design pattern implementations in Python: Singleton, Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc., with real-world adaptations. |
| `architecture/` | Application-level design examples like layered architecture, service modules, DDD-like structuring, CLI/MVC modularization, etc. |
| `features/` | Hands-on usage-focused experiments. Think Baeldung-style learning of Python syntax and APIs. |
| `labs/` | Experimental space for verifying language behavior, side effects, and performance trade-offs. Useful for ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù or stress testing. |
| `internals/` | Deep-dive code for understanding Python internals: GIL, memory model, `sys.getsizeof`, garbage collection, import system, AST and bytecode. |
| `benchmarks/` | Microbenchmarks comparing performance between different approaches, data structures, or algorithms. Often uses `timeit`, `perf`, or `memory_profiler`. |
| `study-sources/` | Code written while following books or courses (e.g., Fluent Python, Real Python, CS50, or Udemy). Organized by source material. |
| `blog-samples/` | Clean and minimal examples intended for blog posts, talks, or external educational content. Polished and documented. |
| `drafts/` | Work-in-progress code, notes, and ideas that aren't yet ready to be placed elsewhere. |

## üß™ How to Use

- Each directory serves a specific learning purpose.
- You can run any script directly with `python script.py`, or use Jupyter notebooks if desired.
- Some directories may include virtual environments, `requirements.txt`, or test suites.

---

## üß∞ Development Tips

- Use `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`, and `pytest` to keep things clean and testable.
- Include inline comments or mini `README.md` files to explain experiments or key learnings.
- Use `drafts/` or `playground/` for scratch work, and organize once it matures.
